# Tavren Backend Resolution Summary

## Fixed ModuleNotFoundError

1. Added missing `__init__.py` file to the `app` directory to make it a proper Python package
2. Created a `dependencies.py` file that imports auth utilities and defines the `get_current_admin_user` dependency
3. Created a PowerShell script (`run_backend.ps1`) that:
   - Sets `PYTHONPATH` to include the project root directory
   - Activates the virtual environment if it exists
   - Runs the application with Uvicorn

## Fixed Pydantic v2 Deprecation Warnings

1. Updated all model configurations in `app/schemas.py` to use the new Pydantic v2 format:
   - Replaced `class Config: orm_mode = True` with `model_config = {"from_attributes": True}`
   - Replaced `schema_extra = {...}` with `json_schema_extra = {...}`

2. Made similar updates to models in:
   - `app/schemas/payment.py`
   - `app/schemas/consent.py`
   - `app/schemas/llm.py`

## How to Run the Backend

### Method 1: Using the PowerShell Script
```powershell
# From inside the tavren-backend directory
.\run_backend.ps1
```

### Method 2: Direct Command
```powershell
# Set PYTHONPATH to current directory
$env:PYTHONPATH = $PWD

# Run the application
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --workers 1
```

## Explanation of the Fix

1. The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.dependencies'` was occurring because:
   - The Python import system couldn't find the `app` package in `sys.path`
   - The missing `__init__.py` file meant Python didn't recognize `app` as a package

2. By setting `PYTHONPATH` to include the current directory, we ensure Python can find the `app` module when absolute imports like `from app.dependencies import ...` are used

3. The Pydantic v2 warnings were fixed by updating the model configurations to use the newer syntax, which improves compatibility with the latest version of Pydantic.
