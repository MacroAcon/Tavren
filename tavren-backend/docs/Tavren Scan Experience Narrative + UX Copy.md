# **Tavren Scan Experience Narrative \+ UX Copy**

## **Purpose**

This document reframes the AI Privacy Scan into a **cinematic onboarding moment**—a story-driven user experience designed to:

* Wake up the user’s sense of injustice

* Help them feel seen and safe

* Invite them into control with zero cognitive friction

It’s not about stats or toggles. It’s about emotion, power, and dignity.

## **🎬 Scene One: The Welcome**

**Header:**

*They’ve been watching. You’ve been giving. Let’s change that.*

**Body:**

Tavren will scan your digital trail—the one you’ve been leaving behind for years. You’ll see what others have seen. And then, you’ll choose what’s next.

**CTA Button:** *“Begin the Scan”*

## **🧠 Scene Two: The Scan (Animated / Simulated)**

**Visuals:**

* Swirling lines of app activity, location pings, invisible trackers

* As if your device is showing what it’s silently broadcasting

**Overlay Copy (timed fade-ins):**

* “Mapping app traces…”

* “Counting location requests…”

* “Looking at who’s watching… without your permission.”

**Final Line:**

*You’ve shared more than you meant to. But not anymore.*

## **✋ Scene Three: The Reveal**

**Header:**

*We scanned your footprint. Here’s what’s been following you.*

**Report Panel Copy (examples):**

* "3 ad networks still tracking your browsing across apps"

* "11 apps accessing location weekly—2 without clear consent"

* "Data shared in the background every 4 hours"

**Tagline-style pull:**

*It’s your trail. Let’s make it work for you.*
