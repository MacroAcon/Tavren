# **Tavren Agent Messaging: Integration of Google A2A and Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

## **Purpose**

This document outlines how Tavren integrates the [Google A2A Protocol](https://github.com/google/A2A) and the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/mcp-overview) within its consent-based data economy framework. Our goal is to ensure agent interoperability while preserving rich, auditable context for ethical decision-making and alignment.

## **Overview**

Tavren-trained agents exchange structured messages with third-party buyers and internal systems using a hybrid approach:

* **A2A** defines the *outer message schema* for clear, interoperable communication.

* **MCP** defines the *inner context model* that governs permissioned data access and behavioral boundaries.

* **Tavren-native metadata** embeds value signals, user trust posture, and consent-grounded explanations.

This combination allows Tavren agents to participate in open agent ecosystems while maintaining alignment to user-defined consent and real-world ethical standards.

## **Message Composition**

All outbound and inbound agent messages follow the A2A envelope format:

{  
  "a2a\_version": "0.1",  
  "message\_id": "...",  
  "timestamp": "...",  
  "sender": "agent:tavren/anon:\<user\_id\>",  
  "recipient": "agent:buyer/\<org\_id\>",  
  "message\_type": "REQUEST" | "RESPONSE" | "INFORMATION",  
  "content": {  
    "format": "application/json",  
    "body": { ... }  
  },  
  "metadata": {  
    "epistemic\_status": { ... },  
    "mcp\_context": { ... },  
    "tavren": { ... }  
  }  
}

### **`epistemic_status`**

Structured justification for the agent's decision, including audit linkages and confidence level.

### **`mcp_context`**

MCP-compliant metadata describing the consent envelope:

* `consent_id`, `purpose`, `data_subject`

* `access_level`, `expiry`, `revocation_url`

### **`tavren`**

Additional metadata used to:

* Track agent version and alignment strategy

* Include user trust score at the time of action

* Embed offer value and user rationale for acceptance or rejection

## **Agent Behavior Example**

A Tavren agent receiving an offer to share app usage data for $0.75 might:

1. Retrieve the user’s latest `preference_snapshot`

2. Evaluate the offer against the allowed `consent_tiers`

3. Respond with an A2A `RESPONSE` message, including:

   * Decline reason ("violates persistent access boundary")

   * Suggested alternative (e.g. 3-day anonymized data for $0.50)

   * Full MCP \+ Tavren context

## **Benefits of This Integration**

* **Interoperability**: Compatible with any ecosystem adopting A2A

* **Alignment**: Reinforces user values via structured, traceable metadata

* **Auditability**: Every message is context-grounded and reversible

* **Trainability**: Message logs double as training data for supervised fine-tuning or RLHF

## **Future Work**

* Export Tavren logs in A2A \+ MCP format for cross-agent training

* Support A2A message relaying between multi-hop agents

* Add intent-resolution layer to bridge unstructured user goals with structured MCP expressions

## **Summary**

Tavren agents use Google’s A2A format as a universal envelope for agent communication, enriched by Pandacea-style MCP metadata and Tavren-specific value signals. This ensures that even in open multi-agent systems, Tavren’s ethical guardrails, audit trails, and consent mechanisms remain intact.

"Tavren doesn’t just talk like other agents. It remembers who it’s speaking for."
