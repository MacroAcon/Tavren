# Fix Summary for Import Error

## Issue Fixed
- Fixed the import error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.models.user'; 'app.models' is not a package` by changing the import in `app/dependencies.py` from:
  ```python
  from .models.user import User
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  from .models import User
  ```

## Testing
- Created a test script to verify that the `User` class can be imported from `app.models`
- The test script successfully imports the User model
- Simple tests that only import the User model pass successfully

## Explanation
The original code was trying to import from a module structure that didn't exist:
- `app.models` is a flat file, not a package with submodules
- We updated the import statement to match the actual project structure, which has the `User` class defined directly in `models.py`

## Dependencies Installed
During the debugging process, we installed several missing dependencies:
- `fastapi`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `pydantic-settings`
- `pgvector`
- `slowapi`
- `cryptography`

## Additional Observations
- There appears to be a circular import issue between `app.auth` and possibly other modules
- The warning about `get_current_active_user` suggests that there are circular dependencies that need to be addressed

## Next Steps
1. Address circular dependencies in the codebase
2. Ensure all required dependencies are correctly installed
3. Run the application with the proper environment variables set

## Running the Backend
To run the backend, ensure your PYTHONPATH includes the project root:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = $PWD
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Or use the script:

```powershell
.\run_backend.ps1
```
