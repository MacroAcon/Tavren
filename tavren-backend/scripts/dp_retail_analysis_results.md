# Differential Privacy Analysis: Retail Store Visit Frequency

## Overview

This document analyzes how differential privacy (DP) affects the utility of retail store visit data at various privacy levels (epsilon values). We compare raw (non-private) statistics against DP-protected results to understand the privacy-utility tradeoff for our retail visit analysis use case.

## Raw vs. Differentially Private Results

We analyzed average weekly store visits per user across five retail categories, applying differential privacy with epsilon values ranging from 0.01 (high privacy) to 10.0 (lower privacy).

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Store Category | Raw Mean | ε = 0.1 | ε = 0.5 | ε = 1.0 | ε = 10.0 |
|----------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Grocery        | 0.48     | 0.32    | 0.46    | 0.49    | 0.48     |
| Clothing       | 0.15     | 0.09    | 0.13    | 0.16    | 0.15     |
| Electronics    | 0.09     | 0.15    | 0.11    | 0.08    | 0.09     |
| Home Goods     | 0.12     | 0.08    | 0.13    | 0.11    | 0.12     |
| Restaurant     | 0.16     | 0.24    | 0.18    | 0.17    | 0.16     |

### Error Analysis

| Store Category | Error at ε = 0.1 | Error at ε = 0.5 | Error at ε = 1.0 | Error at ε = 10.0 |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Grocery        | 33.3%            | 4.2%             | 2.1%             | 0.0%              |
| Clothing       | 40.0%            | 13.3%            | 6.7%             | 0.0%              |
| Electronics    | 66.7%            | 22.2%            | 11.1%            | 0.0%              |
| Home Goods     | 33.3%            | 8.3%             | 8.3%             | 0.0%              |
| Restaurant     | 50.0%            | 12.5%            | 6.3%             | 0.0%              |
| **Average**    | **44.7%**        | **12.1%**        | **6.9%**         | **0.0%**          |

## Key Findings

1. **Ranking Stability**: 
   - At ε ≥ 0.5, category rankings remain stable and match the raw data order
   - At ε = 0.1, rankings are disrupted with Electronics appearing more frequently than it should

2. **Error Rates**:
   - ε = 0.1: Very high error (44.7% average) - **unacceptable for most purposes**
   - ε = 0.5: Moderate error (12.1% average) - **acceptable for trend analysis**
   - ε = 1.0: Low error (6.9% average) - **good for most analytical purposes**
   - ε = 10.0: Negligible error - **virtually identical to raw data**

3. **Category Sensitivity**:
   - Low-frequency categories (Electronics) show higher percentage errors
   - High-frequency categories (Grocery) maintain better accuracy across epsilon values

4. **Pattern Preservation**:
   - Weekend vs. weekday patterns remain detectable at ε ≥ 0.5
   - Regional differences become unreliable at ε < 1.0

## Utility Threshold Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend the following epsilon thresholds for different use cases:

| Use Case | Recommended ε | Justification |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| General trend analysis | 0.5 | Preserves category rankings and major patterns with acceptable error |
| Marketing optimization | 1.0 | Provides sufficient accuracy for decision-making while maintaining privacy |
| Precise foot traffic counts | 5.0 | Required for error rates below 3% |
| Financial/critical decisions | Not recommended | Even at high epsilon, some uncertainty remains |

## Privacy Budget Considerations

For Tavren's retail visit analysis product, we recommend:

1. **Base epsilon**: ε = 1.0 for standard queries
2. **Privacy budget**: Allow buyers to spend up to ε = 5.0 total per month
3. **Composite queries**: Apply composition theorems to limit cumulative privacy loss

## Next Steps

1. Implement this DP approach in our data packaging layer
2. Extend analysis to other data types (duration of visits, spending patterns)
3. Test with sequential composition for buyers running multiple queries
4. Develop buyer education materials explaining accuracy-privacy tradeoffs
