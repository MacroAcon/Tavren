## **💬 Common Questions**

**Q: What if I don’t understand an offer?**

Every offer includes a plain-English explanation. If something feels off, skip it.

**Q: Is this like selling my data?**

No. You’re not uploading a file. You’re granting temporary, revocable permission to access specific behavior. Think of it like lending, not selling.

**Q: Can Tavren see all my phone activity?**

Only what you allow. You choose what gets shared, when, and for how long.

**Q: Do I need to leave the app open all the time?**

Nope. Most offers run quietly in the background. You’ll get notifications when things change or when it’s time to claim a reward.

**Q: Will this kill my battery?**

No. Tavren uses efficient, event-based triggers. It won’t drain your battery like GPS apps or games.
