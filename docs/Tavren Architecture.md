# **Tavren Architecture**

This document outlines the core architectural components of Tavren: a consent-based, reward-for-data platform designed to operate within today’s centralized digital economy. It is optimized for scale, speed to market, and user clarity—not protocol purity.

Tavren’s system balances consent enforcement, lightweight offer routing, and simple compensation without requiring decentralization, blockchain, or complex cryptography.

## **High-Level Flow**

User → Sees Offer → Grants Permission → Data Packaged → Reward Delivered → Buyer Receives Payload

---

## **Core Components**

### **1\. User Interface (Web/Mobile)**

* Displays available data offers

* Handles account creation, authentication, and onboarding

* Provides a Consent Wallet view of what’s shared

* Lets users revoke previously granted access

* Shows reward history and earnings status

### **2\. Consent Wallet**

* Tracks individual permissions granted by the user

* Defines access duration and data type (e.g., location, app usage)

* Stores revocation status and audit logs

* Lightweight, user-readable model (JSON-based or similar)

### **3\. Offer Feed**

* Backend service that curates offers for each user based on available data types, location, and trust tier

* Supports flat offers ("share 7 days of app usage for $0.75") and recurring offers ("daily app activity for $0.10/day")

* Includes optional targeting logic for offer visibility

### **4\. Reward Engine**

* Calculates reward amount based on tier, trust level, and offer fulfillment

* Tracks fulfillment status and manages cooldowns or revocation penalties if applicable

* Integrates with a payment processor (e.g., Stripe Connect, PayPal Payouts)

### **5\. Data Packaging Layer**

* Pulls and formats data according to the accepted offer parameters

* Includes filters based on anonymization level and buyer access tier

* Ensures expiration dates or revocation logic are respected

* Exports payload to secure delivery queue for buyer

### **6\. Buyer API Gateway**

* Provides authenticated access for data buyers

* Enables creation and configuration of offers

* Handles retrieval of fulfilled payloads based on completed user permissions

* Applies buyer Trust Tier constraints (e.g., minimum disclosure level, flag history)

### **7\. Audit Layer**

* Logs every permission grant, revocation, and reward

* Stores structured logs tied to user account (non-public)

* Includes downloadable audit trail for user

* Optional: export to Pandacea-compatible format in future versions

## **Optional Subsystems**

### **Trust Tier System**

* Scores data buyers based on fulfillment rate, dispute record, and user flagging

* Allows trusted buyers to offer more sensitive or higher-tier data requests

* Potential future feature: allows users to auto-accept from specific tiers

### **Notification Service**

* Sends push/email/app messages for:

  * New offers available

  * Reward received

  * Offer expired

  * Consent reminder

### **Internal Admin Dashboard**

* Allows Tavren moderators to manage offers, investigate abuse, and maintain offer pool quality

* View aggregate system stats and identify anomalies

---

## **Deployment Model**

* Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis

* Frontend: React (web), React Native (mobile)

* Infra: Dockerized with CI/CD pipelines for rapid updates

* Payments: Integrated via Stripe API

* Auth: Magic link or OAuth2 (email-first, low-friction)

---

## **Key Design Principles**

* **Simplicity First:** Every permission must be explainable in one screen

* **Reversibility:** Users can revoke at any time; expired permissions are wiped

* **Security over Complexity:** All data exchanges are logged, no crypto or blockchain needed

* **Performance Matters:** Offers load instantly; users feel like they’re in control, not waiting

* **Transparency:** Users always see what they’ve shared, what they got, and who they shared with

Tavren's architecture is designed for usability and trust. It’s the infrastructure that lets everyday people get paid without needing to understand what data privacy means—and gives them real tools to stay in control.
