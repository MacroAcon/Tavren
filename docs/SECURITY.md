# Tavren Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Tavren backend to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain system integrity.

## Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication system for API access
- Role-based access control for different API endpoints
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Password hashing using secure algorithms

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service attacks:

### Rate Limit Categories

- **Default Rate Limit**: 60 requests per minute for basic operations
- **Search Rate Limit**: 30 requests per minute for standard search operations
- **Complex Search Rate Limit**: 10 requests per minute for resource-intensive operations
- **Embedding Creation Rate Limit**: 10 requests per minute for embedding generation

### Implementation Details

- Redis-based rate limiting using a sliding window approach
- User-specific rate limits when authenticated
- IP-based rate limits for unauthenticated requests
- Appropriate rate limit headers in responses (`X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`)
- Configurable limits based on environment

## Error Handling and Information Security

- Sanitized error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Error ID generation for traceability without exposing implementation details
- Pattern-based filtering of sensitive information in error logs
- Different error verbosity for development and production environments

### Sanitization Patterns

The system automatically sanitizes the following patterns in error messages:

- SQL statements
- File paths
- URLs with credentials
- API keys and tokens
- Connection strings

## Input Validation

- Request validation using Pydantic models
- Type checking and constraints on all input fields
- Sanitization of user-provided content before processing

## Database Security

- Parameterized queries using SQLAlchemy
- Restricted database user permissions
- Database connection pooling with timeout
- Transaction management to prevent data inconsistency

## API Security

- HTTPS-only communication
- CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- Content Security Policy headers
- Request timing monitoring to detect anomalies

## Monitoring and Logging

- Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- Performance monitoring for slow operations
- Rate limit breach detection and logging
- Unique request IDs for traceability

## Data Protection

- Embedding vector storage uses appropriate security measures
- API keys and credentials stored securely
- Data minimization principles applied to responses
- Careful handling of sensitive user data

## Deployment Security

- Containerized application with minimal attack surface
- Regular security updates
- Principle of least privilege applied to service accounts
- Environment-specific configuration separation
