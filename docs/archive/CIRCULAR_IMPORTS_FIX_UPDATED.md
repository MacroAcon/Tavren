# Circular Import Resolution - Updated

This document summarizes the changes made to resolve circular imports in the Tavren backend.

## Problems Identified

The application had several circular import patterns that were causing startup failures:

1. Between `app.dependencies` and `app.auth`
2. Between `app.auth` and `app.utils.rate_limit`
3. Between `app.utils.consent_export` and various model imports
4. Import path issues with models like `app.models.user` vs `app.models`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Dependencies Module Fix

Modified `app/dependencies.py` to use lazy imports:

```python
# Before:
from .auth import get_current_user, get_current_active_user

# After:
def get_current_user():
    """Late import to avoid circular dependency"""
    from .auth import get_current_user as auth_get_current_user
    return auth_get_current_user
```

### 2. Rate Limit Module Fix

Updated `app/utils/rate_limit.py` to use TYPE_CHECKING for imports:

```python
from typing import Optional, Tuple, Dict, Any, TYPE_CHECKING

# Use TYPE_CHECKING to avoid runtime circular imports
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from app.auth import get_current_active_user
```

### 3. Consent Export Module Fix

- Used string-based annotations and lazy imports in `app/utils/consent_export.py`:

```python
# We'll use string-based annotations and TYPE_CHECKING for problematic types
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from app.models import DSRAction
    from app.services.consent_ledger import ConsentLedgerService

async def _get_dsr_actions(self, user_id: str) -> List["DSRAction"]:
    """Get all DSR actions for a user."""
    # Import DSRAction here to avoid circular import
    from app.models import DSRAction
    # ...
```

### 4. Fixed Model Import Paths

Several files were using incorrect import paths. Changed:

```python
# Before
from app.models.user import User

# After
from app.models import User
```

### 5. Fixed Router Import Issues

Updated API router modules with correct import paths:

```python
# Before
from app.auth.dependencies import get_current_user, get_current_admin_user

# After
from app.dependencies import get_current_user, get_current_admin_user
```

## Verification

Circular imports have been resolved as confirmed by the successful execution of our test script:

```
$ python test_circular_fix_simple.py
2025-04-16 21:09:14,055 - __main__ - INFO - Testing import of app.utils.consent_export...
2025-04-16 21:09:14,056 - __main__ - INFO - ✅ Successfully imported app.utils.consent_export
2025-04-16 21:09:14,057 - __main__ - INFO - Testing joint import of auth and dependencies...
2025-04-16 21:09:14,057 - __main__ - INFO - ✅ Successfully imported both auth and dependencies together
2025-04-16 21:09:14,057 - __main__ - INFO - All import tests passed! Circular dependencies have been resolved.
```

## Future Considerations

There may still be some issues with FastAPI and AsyncSession type annotations that cause warnings or errors when initializing routers. These are separate from the circular import problems and could be addressed through:

1. Using string annotations for AsyncSession in function parameters
2. Setting `response_model=None` for route handlers that use AsyncSession
3. Creating a custom dependency function that properly handles AsyncSession type annotations

## Best Practices for Preventing Circular Imports

1. Use lazy imports inside functions when possible
2. Use `TYPE_CHECKING` for type annotations that would cause circular imports
3. Use string-based type hints (e.g., `"User"` instead of `User`) when referring to types from modules that would create circular dependencies
4. Consider restructuring modules to use a more hierarchical design
5. For FastAPI specifically, handle AsyncSession carefully in route parameters
