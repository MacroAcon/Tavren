Tavren Implementation Guide: Legal & Technical Requirements
Core Concepts
Data Processing Model

Tavren is a consent-based platform where users are compensated for sharing specific behavioral data
Users explicitly grant revocable permissions for defined data types and purposes
The model relies on transparent compensation and user control

Legal Framework Implementation
1. Notice Requirements

Create a comprehensive "Notice of Financial Incentive" that clearly explains:

Specific data types being collected (app usage, location, etc.)
How the data will be used and by whom
Compensation offered and calculation methodology
User's right to withdraw consent at any time
How the incentive relates to the data's value



2. Consent Management

Implement a granular consent system with:

Explicit opt-in (no pre-checked boxes)
Purpose-specific consent options
Clear presentation of terms before consent is given
Easy withdrawal mechanism that's as simple as giving consent
Timeline tracking for all consent activities



3. User Control Implementation

Develop user-friendly interfaces for:

Viewing active consents
Revoking specific permissions
Requesting data deletion
Accessing personal data
Tracking compensation history



4. Technical Architecture Requirements

Consent Ledger:

Record User ID, Data Category, Purpose, Consent Status
Timestamp each consent action
Log method of consent (app version, UI element used)
Store version of privacy policy shown at consent time
Create tamper-evident audit trail


Data Packaging Layer:

Apply appropriate anonymization based on access level
Enforce purpose limitation
Respect expiration dates and revocation
Implement secure data transmission protocols



5. Security Requirements

End-to-end encryption for all personal data
Secure deletion capabilities (NIST 800-88 compliant)
Role-based access controls
Strict data minimization principles
Regular security testing and monitoring

Operational Requirements
1. Rights Management Workflow

Unified intake system for all privacy requests
Verification procedures (proportionate to data sensitivity)
Automated workflow for processing consent changes and deletions
Notification system for informing data recipients of changes
Confirmation mechanism for completed actions

2. Jurisdiction-Specific Implementations

US/California:

Develop and document data valuation methodology
Provide at least two deletion request methods
Comply with CCPA/CPRA deletion timelines (10-day confirmation, 45-day completion)
Determine data broker status under the Delete Act


For Global Operations:

Build jurisdiction detection capabilities
Implement different consent flows based on location
Respect varying deletion timelines (GDPR: 1 month, CCPA: 45 days)
Maintain exception documentation for each jurisdiction



3. Communication Guidelines

Avoid property rights terminology (don't use "license," "sell," or "ownership")
Frame as "granting permission" for specific purposes
Use clear, accessible language
Be transparent about data flows and recipient categories
Clearly explain the value exchange

Technical Implementation Priorities

Build secure consent management platform with versioning and audit capabilities
Implement robust identity verification for privacy requests
Create privacy-respecting data collection mechanisms
Develop secure data packaging and transfer protocols
Design comprehensive audit and logging systems

This guide represents the essential requirements for implementing Tavren in a legally compliant manner while maintaining the core business model of compensated data sharing with user control.
