# Tavren Documentation

Welcome to the Tavren documentation repository. Tavren is a privacy-focused, consent-based platform that enables individuals to receive fair compensation for their digital activity within the current data economy.

## About Tavren

Tavren bridges the gap between users generating valuable data and businesses seeking ethical access to that data. Unlike future-focused decentralized protocols, Tavren is designed for immediate market viability with centralized infrastructure that emphasizes user experience, transparent compensation, and strong privacy protections.

**Tagline:** *The next round is on them.*
