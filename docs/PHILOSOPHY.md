## Relationship with Pandacea

While Tavren and Pandacea share a vision for a more equitable data future, they serve different purposes:

- **Tavren**: Present-focused, practical solution for today's data economy
- **Pandacea**: Future-focused, protocol-based framework for tomorrow's ecosystem

Tavren may eventually integrate with Pandacea, but its primary focus is delivering value to users in the current market context.
