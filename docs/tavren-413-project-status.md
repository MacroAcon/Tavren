# Tavren Project Status: Current Progress and Next Steps

## Executive Summary

Tavren is a private, venture-focused platform designed to allow individuals to receive fair compensation for their digital activity within the current data economy. The platform operates on a consent-first model where users explicitly grant revocable permissions for accessing specific types of data, receiving transparent compensation in return.

This document summarizes the current project status across key development tracks and outlines the immediate next steps based on the current Kanban board.

## Project Vision

Tavren aims to bridge the gap between users generating valuable data and businesses seeking ethical access to that data. Unlike future-focused decentralized protocols (such as Pandacea), Tavren is designed for immediate market viability with centralized infrastructure that emphasizes user experience, transparent compensation, and strong privacy protections.

**Tagline:** *The next round is on them.*

## Technical Architecture (Current Status)

The Tavren platform architecture consists of these primary components:

1. **User Interface (Web/Mobile)** - React/React Native frontend
   - Current progress: Initial scaffolding in place (tavren-frontend)
   - Critical for user trust and engagement

2. **Consent Wallet** - Core user permission management
   - Still in planning phase
   - Will require secure audit trail and easy revocation

3. **Offer Feed** - Backend service to curate data sharing opportunities
   - Early development phase
   - Will manage offer visibility and targeting

4. **Reward Engine** - Payment processing system
   - Planning phase
   - Will integrate with payment providers (likely Stripe)

5. **Data Packaging Layer** - Data collection and preparation
   - Early research phase
   - PET implementation research underway

6. **Buyer API Gateway** - Interface for data consumers
   - Planning phase
   - Will need strict verification and access controls

7. **Audit Layer** - Comprehensive logging
   - Basic planning
   - Critical for compliance and trust

## Critical Path Items

1. **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies Implementation**
   - The research and pilot track is on the critical path
   - Strategic decision needed on DP vs. SMPC/HE prioritization

2. **Consent Management Infrastructure**
   - Core to the platform's value proposition
   - Must be compliant with GDPR, CCPA/CPRA requirements

3. **User Onboarding Experience**
   - First impression vital for trust building
   - AI-powered "Privacy Scan" flow needs prioritization

4. **Compensation Model Finalization**
   - Clear communication of value exchange
   - Reliable, transparent payment mechanism

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Value Communication Track**
   - Complete the core messaging document
   - Begin UX design for data impact visualization

2. **PET Stack Pilot**
   - Finalize use case selection document
   - Begin implementation of differential privacy for aggregates

3. **Compliance Infrastructure**
   - Complete TIA template for buyer due diligence
   - Start building the consent audit logging system

4. **Trust UX MVP**
   - Finalize Privacy Center v1 design in Figma
   - Begin frontend implementation of revocation controls

## Key Success Metrics

- User acquisition and retention rates
- Offer acceptance rate
- Active consent permissions per user
- Average earnings per user
- Time to first reward
- Buyer satisfaction with data quality
- Consent revocation rate
- Platform regulatory compliance status
