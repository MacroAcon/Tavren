# SMPC vs. Differential Privacy: Comparison for Tavren

## Executive Summary

This document compares two privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) we've evaluated for Tavren: Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Differential Privacy (DP). Our analysis shows these techniques serve complementary purposes in Tavren's privacy stack. We recommend implementing DP as the primary protection for buyer queries, while selectively using SMPC for specific multi-organizational collaborations.

## Technology Overview

| Feature | Secure Multi-Party Computation | Differential Privacy |
|---------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Core concept** | Computation without revealing inputs | Adding calibrated noise to outputs |
| **Privacy model** | Cryptographic security | Mathematical guarantee of plausible deniability |
| **Computational focus** | Distributed computation across parties | Central or local computation with noise |
| **Primary strength** | Exact results without exposing data | Flexible application to many query types |
| **Implementation complexity** | High; requires coordination protocols | Medium; requires sensitivity analysis |

## Our Implementation Results

We implemented and tested both SMPC and DP for the retail store visit frequency analysis use case:

### Differential Privacy Implementation
- Successfully applied Laplace noise to visit averages
- Demonstrated configurable privacy-utility tradeoff with epsilon values
- Determined ε = 1.0 provides good utility (6.9% average error)
- Simple to implement and easy to integrate with existing systems

### SMPC Implementation
- Simulated additive secret sharing across multiple data holders
- Achieved exact computation without exposing individual data
- Measured communication overhead and scaling characteristics
- Demonstrated quadratic increase in communication with more parties

## Comparative Analysis

### Privacy Guarantees

**Differential Privacy**:
- Formal guarantee that individual presence/absence is masked
- Protection against reconstruction and membership inference attacks
- Protection level adjustable via epsilon parameter

**SMPC**:
- Zero knowledge of individual inputs (information-theoretic security)
- Final result is fully revealed without noise
- No protection against inference from the final result

### Performance & Scalability

**Differential Privacy**:
- Minimal computational overhead
- No additional communication required
- Scales linearly with dataset size
- Works efficiently with billions of data points

**SMPC**:
- Significant communication overhead between parties
- Scales quadratically with number of participants (O(n²))
- Performance degrades with more complex computations
- Practically limited to a small number of parties (2-10)

### Use Case Fit

**Differential Privacy**:
- Well-suited for buyer queries on aggregated Tavren user data
- Excellent for ad-hoc analytics and exploration
- Supports a wide range of statistical queries
- Privacy budget can be managed across multiple queries

**SMPC**:
- Ideal for precise computation across multiple organizations
- Good for predefined operations with exact results needed
- Useful for sensitive cross-organizational analytics
- Best when all parties have similar privacy concerns

### Implementation Complexity

**Differential Privacy**:
- Moderate complexity focused on sensitivity analysis
- Growing ecosystem of libraries (OpenDP, Google DP, etc.)
- Easier to explain to non-technical stakeholders
- Doesn't require coordination between multiple parties

**SMPC**:
- High implementation complexity with multi-round protocols
- Requires careful cryptographic implementation
- Need for synchronization between all participating parties
- Higher risk of implementation vulnerabilities

## Recommended Approach for Tavren

Based on our analysis, we recommend a **hybrid approach** that leverages the strengths of both technologies:

1. **Use DP as the primary privacy layer** for most Tavren data operations:
   - Apply DP to all buyer queries on user data with ε = 1.0 as default
   - Implement privacy budget tracking per user
   - Utilize the OpenDP library for core implementation

2. **Selectively apply SMPC for specific collaborative scenarios**:
   - Use SMPC when Tavren collaborates with other organizations (e.g., retailers, research institutions)
   - Apply for precise computations where exact results are critical
   - Limit to predefined operations with small numbers of parties

3. **Consider combining techniques** for enhanced privacy:
   - Apply DP noise before sharing data via SMPC
   - Use SMPC to compute privacy budget consumption across organizations
   - Explore threshold SMPC for distributed epsilon selection

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core DP Implementation (Weeks 1-6)
- Implement DP in the Data Packaging Layer as previously outlined
- Build privacy budget management system
- Create buyer interface for understanding DP results

### Phase 2: SMPC Proof-of-Concept (Weeks 7-12)
- Select a specific multi-organization use case
- Implement SMPC protocol for restricted computation
- Test performance and communication overhead
- Document integration and deployment requirements

### Phase 3: Production Integration (Weeks 13-18)
- Refine implementations based on testing
- Create unified privacy policy covering both approaches
- Develop educational materials for users and buyers
- Deploy to production with monitoring

## Conclusion

Both DP and SMPC offer valuable privacy protections for Tavren. DP provides an efficient, scalable solution for most queries with configurable privacy-utility tradeoffs. SMPC enables exact multi-party computations in specific collaborative scenarios. By strategically implementing both technologies, Tavren can offer robust privacy protections while maintaining data utility across a wide range of use cases.
