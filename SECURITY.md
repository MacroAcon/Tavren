# Tavren Security Documentation

This document outlines security practices, recommendations, and implementation details for the Tavren project.

## Secrets Management

### Current Implementation
- Environment variables using `.env` files manage all sensitive configurations
- Admin API keys for protected operations
- JWT secret keys for authentication
- Data encryption keys for sensitive user data
- Development mode auto-generates secure random keys with warnings

### Recommendations
- Use a dedicated secrets management service like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager in production
- Rotate all secrets periodically (at least quarterly)
- Implement secret versioning to track changes
- Use different secrets for different environments (dev/staging/production)
- Consider using a hardware security module (HSM) for critical cryptographic operations
- Implement proper access controls to secrets based on least privilege principle

## Database Security

### Current Implementation
- Database connections use environment variables
- Production database port is not exposed publicly
- SQLAlchemy ORM helps prevent SQL injection

### Recommendations
- Implement database connection pooling with proper timeout and retry strategies
- Enable database encryption at rest
- Set up regular database backups with encryption
- Use database user accounts with minimal required permissions
- Implement row-level security where appropriate
- Add database activity monitoring
- Configure database firewalls to restrict access by IP
- Enforce TLS for all database connections
- Implement query parameterization throughout the application
- Consider adding a database proxy layer (e.g., PgBouncer) for additional security

## Authentication Security

### Current Implementation
- JWT-based authentication with proper expiration
- Token refresh functionality
- Secure token storage in frontend
- Admin-only registration

### Recommendations
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
- Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Add CAPTCHA for public-facing authentication forms
- Consider implementing OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for federated authentication
- Add session management capabilities (view active sessions, remote logout)
- Implement password complexity requirements and secure password recovery
- Set secure and SameSite cookies for all session management
- Add audit logging for all authentication events
- Implement CSRF protection on all state-changing requests

## Code Security

### Current Implementation
- Frontend dependencies have been updated to latest versions
- Proper error handling in critical components
- Type safety through TypeScript on frontend

### Recommendations
- Implement regular automated code scanning (SAST)
- Add dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Enforce code reviews for all changes
- Implement proper input validation across all user inputs
- Sanitize all outputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Consider implementing Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)
- Apply the principle of least privilege throughout the codebase
- Add proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Enforce secure coding standards through linting rules

## Infrastructure Security

### Recommendations
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Use HTTPS with proper TLS configuration (TLS 1.3, strong ciphers)
- Add DDoS protection
- Implement server hardening (remove unnecessary services, apply security patches)
- Set up intrusion detection/prevention systems
- Configure proper network segmentation
- Implement logging and monitoring for security events
- Set up regular vulnerability scans of infrastructure
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) with security scanning
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Deploy to environments with SOC2/ISO27001 compliance

## Data Protection

### Current Implementation
- Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Different anonymization levels available based on use case
- Consent management framework in place

### Recommendations
- Implement data classification and handling procedures
- Add data loss prevention (DLP) controls
- Consider homomorphic encryption for sensitive analytical operations
- Implement full database encryption
- Add row-level encryption for especially sensitive fields
- Implement secure data deletion procedures
- Add regular privacy impact assessments

## Incident Response

### Recommendations
- Create an incident response plan
- Designate security incident responders
- Set up security monitoring and alerting
- Implement automated security event correlation
- Establish communication protocols for security incidents
- Create a vulnerability disclosure policy
- Run tabletop exercises to practice incident response

## Security Maintenance

- Review this security document quarterly
- Conduct regular security training for developers
- Perform annual penetration testing
- Implement continuous security monitoring
- Keep all dependencies updated on a regular schedule
